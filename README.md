# NookBot
This bot is designed to manage the UAF Computer Science Discord server (primarily by adding people to class-specific roles).

## Running
(Assuming you have a working Ruby installation already)
```
bundle
export DISCORD_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
ruby nookbot.rb
```

## Contributing
I don't have strong formatting requirements, just try to match the existing style and Ruby conventions.
